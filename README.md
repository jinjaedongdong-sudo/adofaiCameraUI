# adofaiCameraUI

This repository now includes a basic C# mod skeleton for A Dance of Fire and Ice.
The `CameraEditorMod` project demonstrates switching to a playback camera and
stopping music after previewing. It uses the BepInEx plugin framework.

An additional example shows how to build a **custom easing** editor directly
inside the game.  The mod exposes a timeline slider, layered camera offsets and
a small GUI for editing `AnimationCurve` keys at runtime, following the
templates from the [FLOWERs Mod Development Guide](https://github.com/FLOWERs-Modding/ADOFAI-Mod-Development-Guide).
